As a team we have discussed and reviewed each of the 3 options given to us, We have chosen to go with basing our project off of "Match". We feel we will be able to scale tasks and produce the best ideas for this concept.

For our primary target audience, we have put into consideration that mainly two groups of people will be playing a game like Match, such as younger children in an educational environment or older people during timepass.

Game display, rules and mechanics 

The game will start by displaying a prompt asking you to pick a level between child and adult. Next it will display a set of rules following the game mechanics via a prompt, Once accepted or declined the game will either print "thank you for playing" or it will load you into the game. Once loaded into the game, if selected child a variety of images will pop up, you have to select/drag the right word to the right image to get a score of +1. To win the game you need to get a score of 5. However if you have selected adults a variety of words will pop up with several categories and the objective is to match up the words to their corresponding categories.
