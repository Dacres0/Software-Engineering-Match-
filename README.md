As a team we have discussed and reviewed each of the 3 options given to us, We have chosen to go with basing our project off of "Match". We feel we will be able to scale tasks and produce the best ideas for this concept.

For our primary target audience, we have put into consideration that mainly two groups of people will be playing a game like Match, such as younger children in an educational environment or older people during timepass.

The game will start by displaying a prompt asking you to pick a level between child and adult. Next it will display a set of rules following the game mechanics via a prompt, Once accepted or declined the game will either print "thank you for playing" or it will load you into the game. In the beginning before the game starts there will be a prompt at the bottom saying if you want to quit at any time type "QUIT", this will be accessible for both modes. Once loaded into the game, if selected child a variety of images will pop up, you have to select/drag the right word to the right image to get a score of +1. To win the game you need to get a score of 5/5. If the child gets one wrong the game will prompt "that's incorrect try again!", it will repeat this prompt in a loop until it is correct and then the loop breaks. However if you have selected adults a variety of words will pop up with several categories and the objective is to match up the words to their corresponding categories. Once selected a variety of words into the correct category you get +1, to win you need a score of 5/5. However if you get one wrong the game will prompt "that's incorrect try again!", you get three lives before it prompts "game over" if you did not get it correct. 

In adult mode the game is controlled by 3 lives and words, whereas in the child mode the game is controlled by pictures and infinite lives, both options are able to quit the game at any time.
