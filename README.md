As a team we have discussed and reviewed each of the 3 options given to us, Jigsaw offers a highly interactive experience however there is limited complexity in gameplay, people can easily get tired of repeatedly doing the same thing. Cross word provides a strong cognitive challenge and increases critical thinking skills however for children they may find it too complex and it requires knowledge or guessing which for beginners may loose interest quickly. In the end  We have chosen to go with basing our project off of "Match". We feel we will be able to scale tasks and produce the best ideas for this concept. More so, the task can evolve to fit different themes from geography to professions, it provides a wide range of educational and fun ideas that fit multiple age demographics.

For our primary target audience, we have put into consideration that mainly two groups of people will be playing a game like Match, such as younger children in an educational environment or older people during timepass.

# <ins>**_Game Display, Rules and Mechanics_**</ins>

The game will start by displaying a prompt asking you to pick a level between child and adult. Next it will display a set of rules following the game mechanics via a prompt, Once accepted or declined the game will either print "thank you for playing" or it will load you into the game. In the beginning before the game starts there will be a prompt at the bottom saying if you want to quit at any time type "QUIT", this will be accessible for both modes. Once loaded into the game, if selected child a variety of images will pop up, you have to select/drag the right word to the right image to get a score of +1. To win the game you need to get a score of 5/5. If the child gets one wrong the game will prompt "that's incorrect try again!", it will repeat this prompt in a loop until it is correct and then the loop breaks. However if you have selected adults a variety of words will pop up with several categories and the objective is to match up the words to their corresponding categories. Once selected a variety of words into the correct category you get +1, to win you need a score of 5/5. However if you get one wrong the game will prompt "that's incorrect try again!", you get three lives before it prompts "game over" if you did not get it correct. 

The game rules will begin in the following format:

----------------------------------------------------

**Welcome to Match!**
*Please choose Child or Adult Mode* 

----------------------------------------------------

**How to Play? (Child)**

Match the word to the picture.

Once all the pairs are matched, the game is over.

Do you wish to accept ?

----------------------------------------------------

**How to play? (Adult)**

Match the word into the category 

One all the pairs are matched up, the game is over.

You have 3 lives.

Do you wish to accept ?

----------------------------------------------------


In adult mode the game is controlled by 3 lives and words, whereas in the child mode the game is controlled by pictures and infinite lives, both options are able to quit the game at any time.

-Option to quit at any time

**Frustrations:**

-Doesn't have enough time to spend a long time on one level

-Hates games that don't include lives or a way you can loose

----------------------------------------------------

The game will be based off of 2 user profiles; **Child and Adult**. These profiles will serve as difficulty levels, the child variation catering towards an easier mode, with images. This is to make the game more interactive and easily accessible for a younger person. The younger person will want a game that is easy to play/understand, that does not require a range of skills and a game that interests them with colourful photos. The childs needs will be a simplistic game mode with few functions that make it fun and enjoyable to play. 

The adult mode will be based on categories and lives to which general words can be matched. This is to add difficulty to the game concept, and force the user into decision making. The adult person will want a game that can be challenging at times, something that is a bit more intellectual (word categories instead of photos) as well as the ability to loose the game via volume of lives they have. Their needs include similar things where the game has multiple levels and functions with ability to quit the game at any point. 

# <ins>**_Functional Specifications_**</ins>

**Minimum Requirements**
- Processor: 1.6 GHz or faster
- RAM: 4 GB
- Storage: 4 GB available space
- Operating System: Windows 10
- A desktop with input devices

# <ins>**_High Level Applicational Functions_**</ins>

- An interactive menu, that prompts user to choose between the two user profiles / gamemodes available "Child" and "Adult".
- A rules and instructions screen that displays the objectives of whichever mode is chosen by the user.
- A "drag and drop" mechanism for the child mode, to match the images.
- A quit function that is accessible throughout the entirety of the playthrough, by typing "quit" to exit.
- A scoring and penalty system, that awards +1 points for each correct match, setting a win condition at 5 points, while deducting -1 point per incorrect match (for adult mode), ending the game at 0 lives.
- Replayability function, as offered by the prompt to replay at the end of each round.
- A timer mechanism will be included within the adult user profile, serving as added difficulty, where there can be a short timer per round for the adult to be able to make their decision, otherwise they will lose a life.
- AI Logic is necessary for a more dynamic difficulty, such as being able to adjust accordingly according to the user profile chosen. 
- Collisions will be involved primarily in the child user profile, to detect if the images are dragged and dropped where they should be.

# <ins>**_High Level Non Funtional specifications_**</ins>

**Aesthetics** 

The Match game will have a clean and minimalistic layout/design. For the child mode the aesthetic will contain colourful and playful images (shapes, cartoons, animals). The font will be a nice simplistic font that is easy to read and comprehend, finally the images for the child mode will be high quality and large enough to properly gather what the image displays. 

**Usability**

The game will have a simple navigation system with clear visual cues to understand what next to do, the game allows users of all ages to understand the game mechanics and get started to play the game without any prior skills or experience. There will be two different modes for adults and children so we cater for all ages.

**Feedback style**

Users playng the game will immediately receive feedback/comments after selecting "complete" when the user wants to see if they haved passed or failed the level. More so there will be positive reinforcement once a correct action is completed users will be rewards with a "correct!" +1

**Basic needs**

There will be two different modes that you can choose "adult" or "child", inside this there will be a possibility for a variety of levels for this game. Upon the game starting after selecting adult or child, the game will display the apropriate rules and instructions based on the mode selected. There will also be an option to restart and quit at any time, this will be via a user typing "QUIT", this will break the entire game at any time. 


**Error handling** 

If a user selects the wrong answer, they will be prompted to try again. If you have selected the child mode, the incorrect answer will trigger a repeat prompt until it is correct, however for the adult mode, the player will be given three chances before the game ends with a prompt saying "Game Over!".
