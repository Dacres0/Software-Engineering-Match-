As a team we have discussed and reviewed each of the 3 options given to us, and have chosen to go with basing our project off of "Match". We feel we will be able to scale tasks and produce the best ideas for this concept.

For our primary target audience, we have put into consideration that mainly two groups of people will be playing a game like Match, such as younger children in an educational environment or older people during timepass.
